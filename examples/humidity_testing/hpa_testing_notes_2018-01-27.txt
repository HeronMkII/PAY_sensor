The testing code is officially finished and tested to be functional. The humidity
testing will be on the following aspect of the SSM_v2 board:
1. the humidity and temperature sensor readings
2. two LEDs blinking, as an indication of the board's functionality
3. the motor driver (MF_1) functionality under humidity

Notes on applying HPA conformal coating

Datasheet of HPA available here:https://www.electrolube.com/products/conformal-coatings/hpa/acrylic/
Detailed procedure of applying see the datasheet

FOR ANYONE THAT IS GOING TO APPLY THE HPA COATING ON A PCB BOARD, PLEASE READ
THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION!
1. Get proper protection: safety glasses, gloves, face mask, long-sleeve clothing,
tie back hair if long hair
2. After wearing the glove, clean the uncoated PCB board with alcohol and proper
tissue before applying the coating
3. Cover the parts that is going to have electrical connections in the future with
masking tape (anything that is closer to paper) rather than electrical tape (the later
will react with the coating and curl up, thus cannot serve the purpose of protection)
4. Apply the more even surface of the PCB board FIRST! (usually the back of the board)
5. After applying one/two layer (one/two sweep if spraying), wait for ~ten minute to dry
6. Turn the board over and apply the coating on the relatively uneven surface.
Note that for area with more ICs and circuits connections, spray one or two more
layers of coating for better performance.
7. The complete curing time for the coating is 24 hours under 20 degree Celsius.
