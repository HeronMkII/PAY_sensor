The water-proof testing of the PAY_SSM_v1 on 2018 Jan 26th

coupling seems to present on the area with more uneven/complicated components
-Hypothesis: MISO line should not have any output/reaction, because of the coating
and code did not specify any signal changes
-Observations of signal when pcb was soaked in water:
-MISO reacted with clock slightly and coupled with MOSI significantly
solution: put more layers of coating on the area with more ICs

Problems with this solution:
-Thicker layers are more prone to delamination when scratched

Code testing with the new SSM_v2 PCB board
- The LEDs are blinking, working
- for some reason the MF_1 ports have no voltage thus the motor is not running
- the board is not printing to the serial monitor
